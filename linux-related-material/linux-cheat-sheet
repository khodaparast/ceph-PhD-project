# rememeber, when change something in the network config restart the service
$ service network restart
________
# it returns the host name and IP
 $ grep `hostname` /etc/hosts
 
 
 # give the name of hosts, 
 $ cat /etc/hosts
  output: 
  
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
10.xx.x.xxx node1 
10.xx.x.xxx	node2
10.xx.x.xxx	node3

 
if we have several host on a network, they must be declared in this file, as it has been displayed in output!
