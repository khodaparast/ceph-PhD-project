This creates a new pool named 'scbench' and then performs a write benchmark for 10 seconds.
Notice the --no-cleanup option, which leaves behind some data. The output gives you a good indicator of how fast your
cluster can write data.
Two types of read benchmarks are available: seq for sequential reads and rand for random reads. To perform a read benchmark,
use the commands below:

shell> rados bench -p scbench 10 seq
shell> rados bench -p scbench 10 rand




You can also add the -t parameter to increase the concurrency of reads and writes (defaults to 16 threads), or the -b parameter to change the size of the object being written (defaults to 4 MB). It's also a good idea to run multiple copies of this benchmark against different pools, to see how performance changes with multiple clients.
Once you have the data, you can begin comparing the cluster read and write statistics with the disk-only benchmarks performed earlier, identify how much of a performance gap exists (if any), and start looking for reasons.
You can clean up the benchmark data left behind by the write benchmark with this command:

shell> rados -p scbench cleanup
